There are many other k-mer ranking methods we considered, but ignored here as they performed no better than the used heuristic: weighted sum of species counts w.r.t. k-mer coverages.
To see all methods and versions included, run `cut -f9 -d',' <results>.csv | sort | uniq`.
Some genomes should be filtered as they also are in the reference set. For some, Mash distance estimates are not valid, should remove them from results too.
